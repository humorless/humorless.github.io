I keep seeing people share vibe-coded apps built on TypeScript/React + Supabase — seemingly the default recommendation from Lovable or Cursor. As a Clojure programmer, I can't stay quiet about this. In an era where AI agents are deeply embedded in the development workflow, that choice carries structural hidden costs that almost nobody is talking about.

## Context Window Is the Bottleneck, and Framework Design Determines Burn Rate

LongCodeBench research shows that Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy on bug-fixing tasks drops from 29% to 3% as context grows from 32K to 256K tokens. Chroma tested 18 frontier models and found the same pattern across all of them.

Coding agents accelerate this degradation: every tool call, every file read, every error message accumulates in the context. A 30-step agent session can consume more than ten times the context of a single conversation turn.

Countless efforts are already underway to manage context from the harness-design side — but the tech stack itself has an enormous impact on context efficiency that rarely gets discussed.

## Task-Relevant Subgraph

An AI agent completing a task doesn't need to read the entire codebase — only the files relevant to that task. Call this set the task-relevant subgraph. **The size of the subgraph is determined by the architectural design of the framework, not by the model.**

The problem with TypeScript + React + Supabase is that a single feature naturally spans multiple layers — component, hook, state, API client, type definition — each living in a different file. The subgraph starts large and only grows as shared dependencies accumulate.

AI tends to recommend the stack it was trained on the most, but "easy to generate" is not the same as "efficient for long-term AI-assisted development." These are two different things.

## What Makes a Stack More Agent-Ready

My current go-to is [Clojure Stack Lite](https://stack.bogoyavlensky.com/), and several of its design choices structurally shrink the task-relevant subgraph.

**HTMX eliminates implicit client state.** React state is scattered across multiple interdependent files; to verify behavior, an agent has to simulate browser interactions. HTMX is driven by server responses, so an agent can verify with a plain `curl` — the response is an HTML fragment, right or wrong, no ambiguity.

**HoneySQL eliminates implicit lazy loading.** When an ORM produces an N+1 problem, the debug subgraph includes model definitions, association configs, and migration files, because the issue is buried in implicit behavior. HoneySQL expresses queries as SQL-as-data — no lazy loading, no association magic. N+1 can't happen silently, because the syntax simply doesn't allow it to sneak in. The debug subgraph shrinks from five files to one.

**Blocking IO eliminates implicit error paths.** The fundamental problem with async isn't the syntax — it's that error paths are implicit. Every async call site is a potential break point where an exception can detach from the main flow. To locate a root cause, an agent must trace the entire call chain, and context width grows linearly with chain length. Clojure's blocking IO has no async boundaries; exceptions follow a single path — propagate upward, handled uniformly in middleware. When debugging, an agent only needs two places: the middleware log and the call site the log points to. Context scope stays fixed regardless of system size.

## Explicit Over Implicit Is Not Just a Clojure Virtue

All three points share a common structure: **the less implicit behavior, the smaller the context an agent needs to bring in.**

The point here isn't a framework or language comparison — it's an observation about design philosophy. Explicit over implicit is a virtue for human developers; for AI agents, it's a structural guarantee that they won't go dumb prematurely.

Design principles the Clojure community has championed for years happen to be a competitive advantage in the AI agent era. I've chosen to frame this in terms of context efficiency, hoping it helps more people appreciate what the Clojure community figured out a long time ago.
